        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p> 
            <b>Hi, I'm Brett!</b> <br /> <br />
            I love working with others to build great software with quality code :). I've contributed to corporate software with huge existing codebases, <br />
            led a team to build an app from the ground up, and dabbled in some solo stuff too! You can find more information about my <a href="#projects">projects</a> <br />
            and <a href="#experience">experience</a> below. <br /> <br />
            When I'm not thinking about designing projects or writing code, I enjoy spending my time doing any the following: 
            <ul>
                <li>I love <strong>cooking</strong>! I've slowly been improving my skills in the kitchen and my stomach loves me for it!</li>
                <li>I am an avid <strong>gamer</strong>. I enjoy all sorts of RPGs, but the one that grabs most of my gaming time is World of Warcraft.</li>
                <li>I'm very passionate about long distance <strong>running</strong> and try to get a run in every day.</li>
                <li>And I love <strong>experiencing new things</strong>, meeting new people, and creating new opportunities!</li>
            </ul>
