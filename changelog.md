* I made two main changes to my portfolio site:
  * 1. I moved the navbar to the bottom of the home page, but made it sticky with the use of javascript so that when the user scrolls down, it attaches to the top of the screen. 
  * 2. I used a 3rd party script to help with making my contact form functional. Now, the user can actually send an email to me using the contact form. On a successful send, a confirmation + thank you message modal is displayed. I ran out of time to implement this, but in the future instead of a modal, when the user sends me an email I would get rid of the email form entirely and just display the confirmation + thank you message. 
* I also added a google analytics script to my site in order to track user engagement and make improvements to the UX of my site.

* I ran out of time to do additional styling, however I am generally pretty happy with the way my site looks and I only have a few small style changes in mind for the future anyways.
