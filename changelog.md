* I made two main changes to my portfolio site:
  * 1. I moved the navbar to the bottom of the home page, but made it sticky with the use of javascript so that when the user scrolls down, it attaches to the top of the screen. 
  * 2. I used a 3rd party script to help with making my contact form functional. Now, the user can actually send an email to me using the contact form.
